# Setup

Fork the repo and submit a PR when you are finished.  Please feel free to google, use stackoverflow, or any other resource you normally would short of directly asking another person for assistance. 

You need npm and yarn installed (For Mac, `brew install npm` and `brew install yarn`).

To install run `yarn install`

To start a local server run the command `yarn start` in the root directory of the repository.

# Assignment

Please complete in any order whichever features or questions you wish, but please attempt at least one feature and one question. If you're doing this on-site, it's not expected that everything is completed within an hour.  When complete, just submit a PR.  Thank you!

## Features

* Add validation so that a deal isn't created unless all fields are entered.  Display errors when a field is missing or contains bad data.

* Add ability to remove deals from the `DealsTable` (interface up to you).

* Add ability to publish a deal from the `DealsTable` (interface up to you).

* Add ability to sort deal rows in ascending or descending order by clicking the header cell of the different fields by which you wish to order.

## Questions

* `NewDealForm` will rerender some of its children unnecessarily.  Why? What is the generally recommended solution?

* How would you hook this frontend to a backend (vs storing the data locally in the store only).  How would you load initial data?

* What other suggestions can you make to improve the quality of the code?
